.. _known-issues-typo3-v8:

Compatibility with TYPO3 CMS 8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There's a known issue in TYPO3 CMS 8, whereby clicking on a label when editing a Template Display
record in the backend will make all other labels in the form disappear.
This could not be fixed simply and will be solved by moving from Prototype to jQuery,
which will be done in a later release.

.. _known-issues-nested-if:

Nested IF markers don't work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: text

	<--IF()-->
		...
		<--IF()-->
			...
		<!--ENDIF-->
		...
	<!--ENDIF-->

This feature seems to be obvious, but is quite difficult to implement,
though (at least, with the actual code base). It comes from the way
the template engine works and particularly the general use of regular
expressions to handle the HTML. It would require a complex analysis of
the template to cut up in right parts and supbarts the "IF" markers.

Experience has shown that it's possible to live without this feature.
If the need of nested "IF" markers is required, you many want to have
a look at the "phpdisplay" or "fluiddisplay" Data Consumers.

.. _known-issues-nested-multiple-edit:

Multiple edition is not possible (module web > list)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This would require too much effort for very small benefit. The cases
of multiple edition in templatedisplay are very rare.
